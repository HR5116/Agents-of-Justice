Courtroom Simulation using LLMs
Courtroom Simulation is an educational tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API to generate realistic, multi-role courtroom trial transcripts. Each courtroom participant—Judge, Lawyers, Plaintiff, and Defendant—is represented by an AI agent with a unique persona and prompt.

--- Project Description ---
This project allows users to select a legal case from a CSV file and simulates a full courtroom trial, including:
-Opening statements
-Arguments and witness interrogation
-Closing statements
-Judge’s ruling,
Each phase is generated by a different LLM agent, making it ideal for legal education, mock trials, and demonstrating conversational AI orchestration.

--- Architecture ---
High-Level Workflow:
User selects a case from the CSV file.
Agents are initialized for each courtroom role, each with a unique system prompt.
Simulation runs through trial phases, with agents generating responses in turn.
Transcript is generated and displayed to the user.
